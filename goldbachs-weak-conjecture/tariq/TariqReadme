For the cmd line version please cd into the Tariq directory then run 

`javac Controller.java Goldbach.java TextUserInterface.java`

To run use this command `java Controller`

For a much more visual and enjoyable experience use the previous commit's eclipse version for a responsive textuserInterface 
and a bit more functionality.
