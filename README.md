## Goldbach's Weak Conjecture

### Background 
In number theory, Goldbach's weak conjecture, also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture, the ternary Goldbach problem, or the 3-primes problem, states that

Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. (A prime may be used more than once in the same sum.)

### User Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a Script that when supplied with a file of odd numbers will Describe the given input as the sum of 3 prime numbers

### Specification
- Can Be written in **Any** Language
- The Script must accept a file that will list all of the numbers to be tested

### Notes
- 1 is **not** a prime number

### Example Ouptu
```BASH
 93197 = 93187 + 3 + 7
